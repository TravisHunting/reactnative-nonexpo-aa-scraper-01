# Start metro server, automatically load app into running android emulator:
npx react-native run-android

If youâ€™re working with a plain React Native project (not Expo), npx react-native run-android is generally the easiest and most straightforward command to build and run your app on a connected Android device or emulator.
What it does under the hood:
Builds the app (gradlew assembleDebug),
Installs the APK on your device/emulator,
Launches the app automatically.

# full compile + test + package process.
# APK file(s) land here: android/app/build/outputs/apk/
cd android && .\gradlew build
