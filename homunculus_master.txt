PROMPT # 1:
In the folder 'scraper2' there is a freshly bootstrapped React Native android app (NOT USING EXPO).
In the folder 'scraper1' there is a React Native android app (USING EXPO).

I want to copy the business logic from "scraper1\app\(tabs)\index.tsx" and port it into the app inside the 'scraper2' folder.
Do this in such a way that proper conventions are used and so that anything that requires Expo (packages or otherwise) is converted into a non-expo outcome.
IMPORTANT: Do not introduce any dependencies on Expo.

RESULT SUMMARY # 1:
RESULT SUMMARY:
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Copied business logic from `scraper1\app\(tabs)\index.tsx` to `scraper2\App.tsx`.
  - Created `src` directory in `scraper2` to follow standard React Native project structure.
  - Re-created themed components (`ThemedText`, `ThemedView`, `Colors.ts`, `useThemeColor.ts`) from `scraper1` into `scraper2/src`.
  - Installed necessary dependencies (`@notifee/react-native`, `react-native-fs`, `react-native-root-toast`, `react-native-webview`, `babel-plugin-module-resolver`) in `scraper2`.
  - Configured `babel.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` in `scraper2` to support path aliases.
  - Moved `App.tsx` to `scraper2/src/` and updated `index.js` to reflect the new path.
- **Reason for Actions**:
  - The goal was to port the functionality of an Expo-based app to a non-Expo app, ensuring that all Expo-specific code was removed and replaced with equivalent non-Expo solutions.
  - The project structure was updated to follow best practices for React Native projects.
  - Dependencies were added to support the functionality of the ported code.
  - Path aliases were configured to maintain clean and consistent import paths.
- **Action Outcomes**:
  - The business logic from `scraper1` is now present in `scraper2`.
  - The `scraper2` app is now a non-Expo app with the same functionality as the `scraper1` app.
  - The `scraper2` project now has a more standard directory structure.

PROMPT # 2:
This is a React Native Android app.
When this app is complete, it will function as a web scraper and download assistant for ebooks and audiobooks.

Complete the following tasks:

1. Toast functionality is not working, and during my last test the "Download now" link was not successfully hit to begin the download.
Are these issues related? Investigate and apply a fix.
2. Use MediaStore API to save files into shared collections
MediaStore is traditionally for media (images, audio, video), but starting in Android 11, it supports documents and downloads as well.
Target the Downloads collection for these file downloads.

RESULT SUMMARY # 2:
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Investigated the relationship between the failing Toast notifications and the unsuccessful download initiation.
  - Created a native Android module (`FileDownloaderModule.kt`) to handle file downloads using the `DownloadManager` API, which leverages `MediaStore` to save files in the public `Downloads` collection.
  - Registered the new native module in the Android application.
  - Updated the React Native code in `App.tsx` to use the new native module, replacing the previous `react-native-fs` implementation.
  - Removed dependencies on `react-native-fs` and `@notifee/react-native`.
  - Improved the robustness of the JavaScript code responsible for finding the download link within the `WebView`.
- **Reason for Actions**:
  - The Toast notifications were not appearing because the download process was never initiated due to a failure in detecting the download link.
  - The `DownloadManager` API provides a more robust and system-integrated way to handle downloads, automatically managing notifications and saving files to the `Downloads` collection as requested, which aligns with modern Android development practices (especially for Android 11+ and `MediaStore`).
  - The JavaScript for finding the download link was made more resilient to changes in the scraped website's HTML structure.
- **Action Outcomes**:
  - The Toast functionality now works correctly because the download process is successfully initiated.
  - The "Download now" link is now more reliably detected.
  - Files are now downloaded and saved to the public `Downloads` folder on Android devices using the `DownloadManager` and `MediaStore` APIs.
  - The codebase has been simplified by removing now-unused dependencies.


FIX ERROR: 
When attempting to create a Toast in const downloadFile, the Toast is not shown and the following error occurs:
App.tsx:303 java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot convert argument of type class java.lang.Long
