PROMPT # 1:
In the folder 'scraper2' there is a freshly bootstrapped React Native android app (NOT USING EXPO).
In the folder 'scraper1' there is a React Native android app (USING EXPO).

I want to copy the business logic from "scraper1\app\(tabs)\index.tsx" and port it into the app inside the 'scraper2' folder.
Do this in such a way that proper conventions are used and so that anything that requires Expo (packages or otherwise) is converted into a non-expo outcome.
IMPORTANT: Do not introduce any dependencies on Expo.
